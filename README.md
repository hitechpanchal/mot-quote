# mot-quote
This is the project assigned in Section 6 of Full Webstack Developer Course by Dr.Angela Yu.

[The Final Page is here](https://hitechpanchal.github.io/mot-quote/)

It is done using the guidelines below, although have changed certain element's attributes.

TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:

1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

Completed The Motivational Project Website.
I have changed attributes of certain elements. Also have used different font and div sizes than specified in the guidelines. 
The fonts used for <h1> are Playfair and not Baskervilles...  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair,
to center the image I have set margin-left and margin-right to auto,
to center the div quote I have set margin-left and margin-right to 10%,
I changed the back color to match the image color. So no black as a background color.,
also, to match the asthetics of the image, I have used a different color for border.,
the quote below is Mea Culpa https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mea+Culpa
